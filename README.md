## Library Management System Project

I’m thrilled to share my latest project—building a fully functional Library Management System with MySQL! 📚💻

In this project, I designed and implemented a relational database that tracks: ✅ Books and their Authors ✅ Borrowers and their contact info ✅ Loans that map books to borrowers with easy tracking of loan dates and return statuses.

🔗 What’s even cooler? I added foreign keys to enforce the relationships, ensuring that no record exists without proper links to other relevant data, making this system robust and reliable. 💪

From designing the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to crafting complex SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently, this project gave me invaluable experience in: 💡 Structuring relational databases for real-world applications 💡 Writing optimized SQL queries for clean data retrieval 💡 Maintaining data integrity with foreign key constraints

The best part? The system is scalable and can handle more advanced features in the future! 🚀✨
